Hello!
This game is written by a team of two members who both don't have a lot of time to invest in this game. 
So it's possible that some unexpected errors occur when you try to launch this game.
We welcome you to help us fix them.

Note that before handing in this project, I secretly changed the parameters related to 'difficulty'. 
So the game might not be the same as it is in the video. 
But I believe in your intelligence, it must be easy for you to find it out.
